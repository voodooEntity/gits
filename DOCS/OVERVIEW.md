# Documentation Overview
While GITS is a very flexible tool, the documentation can be split into the following five topics. It is recommended to read them in the proposed order. 

1.  [Instance handling](INSTANCES.md)
2.  [Creating/Mapping Data](DATA_MAPPING.md)
3.  [Query Builder](QUERY.md)
4.  [Storage API](STORAGE_API.md)
5.  [Storage Architecture](STORAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Each topic contains necessary information such as definitions/descriptions/examples .**
